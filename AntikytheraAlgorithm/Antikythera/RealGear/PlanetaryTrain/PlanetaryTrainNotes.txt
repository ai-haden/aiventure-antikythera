Planetary gear notes:

This data is from Freeth given in the BBC "The two-thousand year-old computer".

Mars, Jupiter, Saturn: Four gears, pin-and-slot mechanism, like the moon arrangment.

The gear receives its momentum from the (inner) gear-meshing of B1-223. The arrangment is epicyclic.

I have estimated Mars, Venus, and Mercury myself, basing the movements of the same architecture as the other planets.
